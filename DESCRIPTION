Title: Genetic algorithm (GA) for variable selection from high dimensional data
Version: 0.6.1

Description: This package provides a genetic algorithm for finding variable
    subsets in high dimensional data with high prediction performance. The
    genetic algorithm can use oridnary least squares (OLS) regression models or
    partial least squares (PLS) regression models to evaluate the prediction
    power of variable subsets. By supporting different cross-validation
    schemes, the user can fine-tune the tradeoff between speed and quality of
    the solution.
